## File exercises 1 and 2.py
This contains exercises 1 and 2 from Topics 1 and 2. These topics involved Fibonacci numbers.

## File exercise3.py
This contains the program for the Collatz conjecture.
Research was conducted on Wikipedia to learn the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). The resulting program was as a result of a trial and error process.

## File exercise4.py
This is an attempt at programming the [Euler problem 5](https://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-problem-5/)
For research, other solutions were examined but these involved the decomposition of primes, and more advanced programming than covered on the course for this exercise. An attempted program is supplied in the file.

## File exercise5.py
This contains the program for [Fisher's Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

## File exercise6.py
This file contains a program to create a function that calculates factorials and a run to calculate the factorials 5, 7, 10.
This was developed as a result of a trial and error process.
